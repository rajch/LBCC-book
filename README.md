# Let's Build a Compiler for the CLR

This book demonstrates the process of creating a compiler for the Common Language Runtime. It's not heavy on theory, nor does it contain any "best practices". Instead, it very quickly takes the reader through the process of creating a compiler, showing practical, functioning code at every step. Concepts are discussed only when encountered, and discussed using "accurate enough" information.

In short, it's meant for **fun**. Any learning that results from reading it should be considered a side effect, and completely to the reader's credit.

This book owes its existence to a brilliant 15-part article series by Dr. Jack Crenshaw, called "**Let's Build a Compiler**". The original series may be found at [http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/). You really should read it, if you are interested in writing compilers. Especially if you are not a Computer Science student. And even if you are.

Please read this book too, and run the code therein. A working compiler in every chapter from Chapter 1 onwards, I promise.
